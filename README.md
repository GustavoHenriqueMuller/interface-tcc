# interface-tcc
To open in Quartus, simply open the file ```quartus_files/InterfaceTCC.qpf``` as a project.

To compile the interface and all dependencies, run (in Questa):
```cd do_files```
```do do_all.do```

To compile only the interface:
```cd do_files```
```do interface_tcc.do```

To run simulations (all simulations start with ```sim_``` prefix):
```do <simulation_name>```
